                <p>Most of what I've learned, I've learned through reading.</p>

                <p>It’s easy to decide whether a piece of content interests you, just take a look at it and see what it's about, then you can decide if you want to learn more about it, or maybe if you already know about it.</p>

                <p>What’s different about text is, it gives you enough time and space to think about why an author said what they said and how they said it. In conversations or videos, the flow of information is harder to control. With reading, you can just pause and think.</p>

                <p>Also, I really appreciate it when you can tell reading material is the result of care. It gives this energy of mutual respect between the reader and the author.</p>

                <p>I want to do the same with my disorganized thoughts, give myself a space to put my thoughts and ideas through a process and make them more understandable and clear. So that they're more satisfying for me, and maybe even entertaining for you if I'm lucky.</p>
