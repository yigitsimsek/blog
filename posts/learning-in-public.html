                <p>One of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others. Writing about what you're learning forces you to organize your thoughts and identify gaps in your understanding.</p>
                
                <p>This blog is partly an experiment in learning in public. Instead of keeping notes to myself, I'm sharing them. The act of writing for an audience, even a small one, changes how you think about ideas.</p>
                
                <p>You become more careful about accuracy. You think about clarity. You consider whether something is actually worth saying.</p>
                
                <p>There's also something valuable about building a record of your thinking over time. Looking back at old posts can show you how your ideas have evolved, what you've learned, and what you've forgotten.</p>
                
                <p>The internet makes this kind of sharing easier than ever. A simple blog like this one costs almost nothing to maintain and can reach anyone in the world.</p>
                
                <p>Why not take advantage of that?</p>
