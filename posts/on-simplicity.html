                <p>There's something powerful about simplicity. Not the kind that comes from ignorance, but the kind that comes from understanding something so well that you can explain it clearly.</p>
                
                <p>This applies to writing, to code, to design, and to thinking in general. The best solutions are often the simplest ones, but finding them requires going through complexity first.</p>
                
                <p>Einstein supposedly said "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Whether he actually said it or not, the idea is sound.</p>
                
                <p>In building this blog, I chose the simplest approach I could think of: plain HTML, basic CSS, and no unnecessary features. It works, it's fast, and it focuses attention on what matters - the content.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.</p>
