                <p>Hi, I'm Yigit.</p>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to create a blog for a while now.<br>
                    I'll talk about my interests here, maybe use it for brain dumps as well.
                </p>

                <p>A little something about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a software engineer.</li>
                    <li>I'm currently working for a European startup that's doing really well.</li>
                    <li>I recently completed a Vipassana course, so expect some initial posts about that experience.</li>
                    <li>I don't know how you found me, since I haven't shared my blog anywhere.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
